                <h4>How to exercise?</h4>
                <p>
                    First, start with the treadmill or do any kind of warm-up. 5â€“10 minits are inaf. It raises your body temperature and your blood flow, which helps you perform better. Lift fist only with the bar or with a small weight also helps you perform better and helps you prevent injuries, especially during the first exercises. In the case of whole-body exercise, you will experience the most progress in your first exercises, so to achieve overall progress, change the order of them regularly.

                <h4>How much to lift?</h4>
                <p>
                    Your progress is mostly the result of the multiplication of three components. The weight you lift, the number of reps, so how many times you lift without a break, and the number of sets, what is the number of how many times you make, for example 10 reps. To make faster progress, you should choose these three numbers that you get as close to failure as you can. Of course, avoid anything dangerous. The rep number should be 3-20 and the set number 2-5. Try to always raise one of these three components, and you will see the progress.
