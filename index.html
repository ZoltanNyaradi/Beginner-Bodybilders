            <h4>Who we are?</h4>
            <p>We are some guys, whoes multiple thimes failed with the work out,
                but we are in the gym again to succses in the end,
                and to assure that I created this side what help us in the first 3 month.</p>
            <h4>How can this site help?</h4>
            <p>This site has 8 exercises with alternatives, what exercise your whole body.
                You can check the finisched exercises, so you can see easily what's left.
                In a future update you will be also avaible to write your current lifting weight into the site.
                </p>
            <h4>How to exercise?</h4>
            <p>First start with the treadmill, or do any kind of warm up. 5-10 minits is inaf to do a better performance.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can do either low (3-6), moderate (7-11) or high (12-20) repetition number. </li>
                <li>The number of sets you do is the best between 2-5.</li>
                <li>And the weight should be so much, that with the number of sets and reps the exercise have to be chalengeing. And you should time to time incrise it.</li>
              </ul>
             <p>This plan made to go into the gym 3 times a week. If you go less you will less progress,
                if you go more then an isolator weekly workout plan is suits better for you,
                but also true that if you are beginner you don't have to do everything perfect to reach a great progress.
