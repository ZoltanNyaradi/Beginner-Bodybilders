                <p>
                    We're a group of individuals who have multiple times failed with the workout.
                    But we're back in the gym to succeed in the end.
                    And to assure that, I created this site that will help us in the first three months. Welcome to use
                    this site.

                <p>
                    This site features seven exercises with alternatives that collectively target your entire body,
                    ensuring early success without overwhelming with information.
                    It is well-organized, saving you time on individual research and planning.
                    You can review the completed exercises, making it easy to follow your fitness plan.
                    In a future update, you will also have the option to input your current lifting weights into the site,
                    which is especially helpful at the beginning.

                <h4>How to exercise?</h4>
                <p>
                    Begin your workout with a warm-up, such as starting on the treadmill or engaging in any form of light exercise
                    for 5â€“10 minutes. This helps raise your body temperature and enhances blood flow, improving overall performance. When
                    lifting, consider starting with just the bar or a small weight to enhance performance and prevent injuries, particularly
                    during the initial exercises. For full-body workouts, changing the order of exercises regularly can maximize overall
                    progress.
                </p>

                <h4>How much to lift?</h4>
                <p>
                    Your progress is primarily determined by the interaction of three key components: the weight you lift, the
                    number of reps (the times you lift without a break), and the number of sets (the total cycles, e.g., 10 reps). To better
                    progress, choose these three variables to push yourself close to failure while avoiding any unsafe practices.
                    Aim for a rep range of 3-20 and a set range of 2-5. Consistently increase one of these three components, and you'll
                    observe significant progress.
