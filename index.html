                <p>
                    We are some guys who have multiple times failed with the workout.
                    But we're back in the gym to succeed in the end.
                    And to assure that, I created this site that will help us in the first three months. Welcome to use
                    this site.

                <p>
                    This site features seven exercises with alternatives that collectively target your entire body,
                    ensuring early success without overwhelming with information.
                    It is well-organized, saving you time on individual research and planning.
                    You can review the completed exercises, making it easy to follow your fitness plan.
                    In a future update, you will also have the option to input your current lifting weights into the site,
                    which is especially helpful at the beginning.

                <h4>How to exercise?</h4>
                <p>
                    First, start with the treadmill or do any kind of warm-up. 5â€“10 minutes are enough. It raises your body
                    temperature and your blood flow, which helps you perform better. Lift fist only with the bar or with
                    a small weight also helps you perform better and helps you prevent injuries, especially during the
                    first exercises. In the case of whole-body exercise, you will experience the most progress in your
                    first exercises, so to achieve overall progress, change the order of them regularly.

                <h4>How much to lift?</h4>
                <p>
                    Your progress is mostly the result of the multiplication of three components. The weight you lift,
                    the number of reps, so how many times you lift without a break, and the number of sets, what is the
                    number of how many times you make, for example 10 reps. To make faster progress, you should choose
                    these three numbers so, that you get as close to failure, as you can. Of course, avoid anything
                    dangerous. The rep number should be 3-20 and the set number 2-5. Try to always raise one of these
                    three components, and you will see the progress.
